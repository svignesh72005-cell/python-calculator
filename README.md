Multi-Operation Calculator
File Name: calculator.py
Purpose
To perform basic mathematical operations on two numbers entered by the user.

Description:

This program allows the user to select a mathematical operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division) and apply it to two input numbers.
Logic Explanation

Separate functions are created for each operation:

add() for addition
subtract() for subtraction
multiply() for multiplication
divide() for division
The user selects an operation using a menu.
Two numbers are taken as input.
Based on the user’s choice, the corresponding function is called.
Division by zero is handled to avoid runtime errors.

Concepts Used:
Functions
Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
User input and output

Logic-Based Guessing Game

File Name: guessing_game.py

Purpose:
To improve logical thinking using loops and conditional statements.

Description:
The computer randomly generates a number, and the user must guess it correctly.

Logic Explanation:
A random number is generated using the random module.
The program runs inside a while loop until the correct number is guessed.
The user enters a guess on each attempt.

The program compares the guess with the generated number:
If the guess is lower → “Too low”
If the guess is higher → “Too high”
If correct → Success message with number of attempts
The loop ends once the correct number is guessed.

Concepts Used:
Loops (while)
Conditional statements
random module
Counters

Simple File Read and Write Operations:
File Name: file_operations.py

Purpose:
To demonstrate basic file handling operations in Python.

Description:
This program writes user input to a text file and then reads and displays the content from the same file.

Logic Explanation:
The user enters text input.
The program opens a file in write mode and saves the input.
The file is then opened in read mode.
The stored content is read and printed to the terminal.
The with statement is used to safely handle file operations.

Concepts Used:
File handling
open(), read(), write()
Text files

Variables, Loops & Functions Practice

File Name: basics_practice.py

Purpose:
To practice and understand Python’s basic building blocks.

Description:
This program demonstrates the use of variables, functions, loops, and user input.

Logic Explanation:
A function is defined to display a greeting message.
The user enters their name, which is passed to the function.
A for loop prints numbers from 1 to 5.
A while loop performs a countdown.
This program combines multiple basic concepts in a simple flow.

Concepts Used:
Variables
Functions
for loop
while loop
Input and output
